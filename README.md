# Unhandled Database Query Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database queries within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where a database query (simulated here) might fail without proper error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks a mechanism to gracefully handle potential errors during the database query. If the query fails (e.g., due to a database connection issue or a record not being found), the application might crash or return an unexpected response.

## Solution

The solution incorporates proper error handling using a `try...catch` block.  This ensures that even if the database query encounters an error, the application responds appropriately, preventing crashes and providing informative error messages to the client.
